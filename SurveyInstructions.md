# Instructions for Volunteers

## General
- At this time we are collecting information on entrances, building interiors, and exterior obstructions on Penn's campus. During a map-a-thon, please collect information on your group's designated buildings or areas. 
- If you are participating outside of a map-a-thon, please check the [working map](https://arcg.is/LWOfH) before you complete a new survey to avoid duplicate points. You are welcome to edit the working map directly if you'd like to correct or expand any information. 
- If you encounter any difficulties with the surveys or have questions about the process, please contact the project team at upennamp@gmail.com.

## Surveys

1. Entrances: 
	- Fill out the [entrance survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/7cd2d3bd864941a8ae3f3c0182c1da1b).
	- For "Entrance designation" choose a descriptive name for the entrance (for example, North entrance, main entrance, accessible entrance, Walnut Street entrance, etc.).
	- Photograph the entrance. Try to capture ground features and accessibility features. use a landscape orientation and avoid including people in the photograph.
	- If there are multiple entrances, repeat the survey. You need not survey every entrance, but please survey at least one accessible entrance and the primary entrance if there is one.

2. Building Interiors:
	- Fill out the [building survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/61cf45548cc0431c936dc00b9808705d).
	- To gather or verify information on building interiors, you may wish to refer to the relevant [PennAccess Map](https://www.facilities.upenn.edu/maps/pennaccess).
	- As a general rule, we consider spaces "accessible" if they can be reached without stairs and if there's a path of at least 32". 

3. Exterior obstructions:
	- Use the [obstruction survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/210caf35291043579e817d3b954aa2e6) to record information about blocked exterior paths, stairs, large potholes, etc.
	- The "type" of obstruction should be a descriptive word or phrase; these need not be unique. 
	- Photograph the obstruction.
	- In the "description" field, describe the alternate route if there is one.

If at any time you need to correct information from a survey, you may do so directly on the [working map](https://arcg.is/LWOfH), or email the project team at upennamp@gmail.com.

## Guidelines for photographs
- Please do not take pictures of any building interiors.
- Avoid taking pictures with people in them (unless they have given their consent to be photographed).
- If possible, take pictures with landscape orientations to ensure proper display.
- Photographs should prioritize detail over context (make sure you include the entire door, and that the automatic button is visible.

Example:
![The accessible entrance to Van Pelt Library with an automatic door]( https://services3.arcgis.com/9nfxWATFamVUTTGb/arcgis/rest/services/service_c75c8e61112e4e85ab9107f52b834f41/FeatureServer/0/6/attachments/5?token=zLIUqvzJ9i9_nX3tELKDmLeO3l4mYqOnB2_2FGldr7-FbsCOg0RLS2m1VEKHKl-cDZK-CxYaZUtHxqAfFEqHoICNXKlS_NtRuf6n8wXBJhMtSflAQVRy4k7MvpmNLjNwnOqEuwsYAwZ-NBQZeGAE11FkN8WthIOGo-OwL1Gey9_Vvpd5-q5vRugfECW-rv6EsV7g0RRycb_KdGYCQiD4yPesQt4zhfdeNHE8isMec_NB_5v1uRzKy0Otq2EpnuaZtGXomGxvcrIFD7akcpmr4UiU8mPIiAFF2ZtFtryv6Y0.)
