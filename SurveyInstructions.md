# Instructions for Volunteers

## General
- At this time we are collecting information on entrances, building interiors, and exterior obstructions on Penn's campus. During a map-a-thon, please collect information on your group's designated buildings or areas.
- If you are participating outside of a map-a-thon, please check the [working map](https://arcg.is/LWOfH) before you complete a new survey to avoid duplicate points. You are welcome to edit the working map directly if you'd like to correct or expand any information.
- If you encounter any difficulties with the surveys or have questions about the process, please contact the project team at upennamp@gmail.com.

## Surveys

1. Entrances:
	- Fill out the [entrance survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/7cd2d3bd864941a8ae3f3c0182c1da1b).
	- Use the [building log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAa76--OkCjWWZBBI-jJrrksBfilDFSyNZQ9dVgOw8I/edit?usp=sharing) to find the numerical building code.
	- For "Entrance designation" choose a descriptive name for the entrance (for example, North entrance, main entrance, accessible entrance, Walnut Street entrance, etc.).
	- Try to be as precise as you can in setting the geopoint location.
	- We define 'stairs' as one or more steps of at least 3" and a 'ramp' as any slight incline or slope.
	- Photograph the entrance. Try to capture ground features and accessibility features. use a landscape orientation and avoid including people in the photograph.
	- If there are multiple entrances, repeat the survey. You need not survey every entrance, but please survey at least one accessible entrance and the primary entrance if there is one.
	- For 'notes' please describe the features of the entrance. (e.g. 'Two sets of shallow concrete steps lead; glass double-doors open out and are relatively heavy'; 'automatic door activated by a metal button on a  pole'). This will serve as alternative text for the image. These descriptions are subjective, of course, but do your best.

2. Building Interiors:
	- Fill out the [building interiors survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/2ba4b327c9e3465ba39593ff6e83a037).
	- Use the [building log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAa76--OkCjWWZBBI-jJrrksBfilDFSyNZQ9dVgOw8I/edit?usp=sharing) to find the numerical building code.
	- To gather or verify information on building interiors, you may wish to refer to the relevant [PennAccess Map](https://www.facilities.upenn.edu/maps/pennaccess).
	- As a general rule, we consider spaces "accessible" if they can be reached without stairs and if there's a path of at least 32".
	- Chemicals: here describe any strong scents or likely allergens. (For example: â€œcafe in the basement smells strongly of coffee" or "carpet in hallway has mildew"; "potted plants in the lobby").  

3. Exterior obstructions:
	- Use the [obstruction survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/210caf35291043579e817d3b954aa2e6) to record information about blocked exterior paths, stairs, large potholes, etc.
	- The "type" of obstruction should be a descriptive word or phrase; these need not be unique.
	- Photograph the obstruction.
	- In the "description" field, describe the alternate route if there is one.

All three surveys and the map they create can be accessed from our [Crowdsource Reporter web app](https://upenn.maps.arcgis.com/apps/CrowdsourceReporter/index.html?appid=d23c349a2c7346c0b6f39879ede52ec8). If at any time you need to correct information from a survey, you may do so directly on the [working map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=b42a011873df4ebd9d61e8accaee5ecb&extent=-75.2029,39.9461,-75.1827,39.9569), or email the project team at upennamp@gmail.com.

## Guidelines for photographs
- Please do not take pictures of any building interiors.
- Avoid taking pictures with people in them (unless they have given their consent to be photographed).
- If possible, take pictures with landscape orientations to ensure proper display.
- Photographs should prioritize detail over context (make sure you include the entire door, and that the automatic button is visible.

Example:
![The accessible entrance to Van Pelt Library with an automatic door]( https://services3.arcgis.com/9nfxWATFamVUTTGb/arcgis/rest/services/service_c75c8e61112e4e85ab9107f52b834f41/FeatureServer/0/6/attachments/5?token=zLIUqvzJ9i9_nX3tELKDmLeO3l4mYqOnB2_2FGldr7-FbsCOg0RLS2m1VEKHKl-cDZK-CxYaZUtHxqAfFEqHoICNXKlS_NtRuf6n8wXBJhMtSflAQVRy4k7MvpmNLjNwnOqEuwsYAwZ-NBQZeGAE11FkN8WthIOGo-OwL1Gey9_Vvpd5-q5vRugfECW-rv6EsV7g0RRycb_KdGYCQiD4yPesQt4zhfdeNHE8isMec_NB_5v1uRzKy0Otq2EpnuaZtGXomGxvcrIFD7akcpmr4UiU8mPIiAFF2ZtFtryv6Y0.)
