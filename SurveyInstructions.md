# Survey overview

## Surveys
For each building, your group will collect information on Entrances and Building Interiors. There is a stand-alone survey for both. There is also a stand-alone survey for Obstructions. All three surveys can be accessed from the Crowdsource Reporter App.  

1. Entrances: 
	- Fill out the [entrance survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/7cd2d3bd864941a8ae3f3c0182c1da1b).
	- For "Entrance designation" choose a name (ie North entrance, main entrance, or accessible entrance) 
	- Photograph the entrance. Try to capture ground features and accessibility features. use a landscape orientation and 
	- Describe and locate building entrances. 
	- If there are multiple entrances, repeat the survey. You need not survey every entrance, but please survey at least one accessible entrance and the "main" entrance if there is an obvious one.

2. Building Interiors:
	- Fill out the [building survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/61cf45548cc0431c936dc00b9808705d).
	- To gather or verify information on building interiors, you may wish to refer to the relevant [PennAccess Map](https://www.facilities.upenn.edu/maps/pennaccess).
	- As a general rule, we consider spaces "accessible" if they can be reached without stairs and if there's a path of at least 32"

3. Exterior obstructions:
	- Use the [obstruction survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/210caf35291043579e817d3b954aa2e6) to record information about blocked exterior paths, stairs, large potholes, etc.
	- Photograph the obstruction

If at any time you need to correct information from a survey, you may do so on the [working map](https://arcg.is/LWOfH) or email the project team at upennamp@gmail.com. Feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns

## Guidelines for photographs
- Please do not take pictures of building interiors
- Avoid taking pictures with people in them (unless they have given their consent to be photographed)
- If possible, take pictures with landscape orientations to ensure proper display
- Photographs should prioritize detail over context (make sure you include the entire door, and that the automatic button is visible.

Example:
![The accessible entrance to Van Pelt Library with an automatic door]( https://services3.arcgis.com/9nfxWATFamVUTTGb/arcgis/rest/services/service_c75c8e61112e4e85ab9107f52b834f41/FeatureServer/0/6/attachments/5?token=zLIUqvzJ9i9_nX3tELKDmLeO3l4mYqOnB2_2FGldr7-FbsCOg0RLS2m1VEKHKl-cDZK-CxYaZUtHxqAfFEqHoICNXKlS_NtRuf6n8wXBJhMtSflAQVRy4k7MvpmNLjNwnOqEuwsYAwZ-NBQZeGAE11FkN8WthIOGo-OwL1Gey9_Vvpd5-q5vRugfECW-rv6EsV7g0RRycb_KdGYCQiD4yPesQt4zhfdeNHE8isMec_NB_5v1uRzKy0Otq2EpnuaZtGXomGxvcrIFD7akcpmr4UiU8mPIiAFF2ZtFtryv6Y0.)
