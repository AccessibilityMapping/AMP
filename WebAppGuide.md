## Adding entries

The best way to **add entries** is through the info button on the left side of the screen.

Survey instructions will take you to a page containing instructions for all three surveys.

Click on the survey you are interested in. 

All of the surveys have a **Point** section with a **map** at the start that looks like:

![Point Survey](Images/PointSurvey.png)

Here you get to choose the **spot** you are interested in. 

The map has tools that help you locate the spot more easily. 

On the left side you will see the following:

* The home button will return you to the world view.
* In the search bar you can type in locations such as “University of Pennsylvania” and the map will display that location.
* Press the + button to zoom in.
* Press the - button to zoom out.
* Press the crosshair to have the map show you your current location (It is not completely accurate).

At the center of the screen is a blue icon, place it in the spot you are interested in. To do so drag your mouse or finger through the map to the desired spot. 

Once you are done filling the survey, your entry should appear in the map.

## Deleting Entries

In case you want to delete your entry: 
* Click on your entry on the map, a window should pop up.
* Click on the three dots on the bottom right.
* Select edit, two windows should pop up, ignore the "Edit" window.
* Scroll down on the other window and click on delete. 

## Using the Map

The map provides very useful information, to use the query click on the following icon:

![Filter Search](Images/FilterSearch.PNG)

From here you will see a list pop up with different types of spaces or resources within a building:

![Query](Images/Query.PNG)

By clicking on one of them you should see a blue circle appear surrounding any location in the map that contains the space or resource you specified.
