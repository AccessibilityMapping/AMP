# Instructions for group leaders

## General

- Keep your ID and nametag visible at all times and encourage your group to do the same.
- Please cooperate with any instructions from public safety or building staff. If they have questions have them call Alice or Mark.
- At present we are only surveying buildings marked "1" in the priority column on the [building log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAa76--OkCjWWZBBI-jJrrksBfilDFSyNZQ9dVgOw8I/edit?usp=sharing). We have alerted the facilities managers of these buildings. To avoid redundancy and security concerns, please stick to your designated buildings.
-All three surveys and the map they create can be accessed from our [Crowdsource Reporter web app](https://upenn.maps.arcgis.com/apps/CrowdsourceReporter/index.html?appid=d23c349a2c7346c0b6f39879ede52ec8).
-If at any time you need to correct information from a survey, you may do so directly on the [working map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=b42a011873df4ebd9d61e8accaee5ecb&extent=-75.2029,39.9461,-75.1827,39.9569), or email the project team at upennamp@gmail.com.
- For any questions during the map-a-thon, please use our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/accessmapping/shared_invite/enQtMzIxNjgyMTc0NTQ2LWJkOWVhN2Q2NmU2YTA5ZTRjOTUyYmQxZmNlZDhhYmIwZWJlNGEzZGVhYTUyOGZjNDkxMGVmMzUzYTE0OWM4N2Q) and we will respond as soon as we can. For urgent questions, please call Alice or Mark.

## Survey process
- For each building you are assigned, your group will collect information on [building entrances](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/7cd2d3bd864941a8ae3f3c0182c1da1b)
 and [building interiors](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/61cf45548cc0431c936dc00b9808705d). Designated teams will collect information on [exterior obstructions](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/210caf35291043579e817d3b954aa2e6). All three surveys will be on the Crowdsource Reporter App (link to come).
- Refer your group members to the [survey instructions and photo guidelines](https://github.com/AccessibilityMapping/AMP/blob/master/SurveyInstructions.md).
- Use the [building log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAa76--OkCjWWZBBI-jJrrksBfilDFSyNZQ9dVgOw8I/edit?usp=sharing) to record your group's progress.
- Make sure that your group members use the correct building code and building name from the building log. If you are unable to find a building code, make sure the building name is standardized. In cases where a single structure is recorded twice on the building log, you may eliminate the redundant entry and choose the most descriptive name.

## Feedback
- Here's a mock-up of our [Map display](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/92e0137722ef4bcd9164e63df21119c4), which we will update as data is gathered.
- Encounter any difficulties with this process? Have ideas for other categories of access? We want your feedback--email us at upennamp@gmail.com, contribute to this [feedback googledoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tW2kiAsPx5GITntZakYCHAG7793bLwngCgzgrSIycU4/edit?usp=sharing), or send us a Slack message.
