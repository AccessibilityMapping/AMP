# Instructions for group leaders

## General

- Keep your ID and name tag visible at all times and encourage your group to do the same.
- Please cooperate with any instructions from public safety or building staff. If they have questions have them call Alice.
- During the map-a-thon, please stick to the buildings your group has been assigned unless instructed otherwise. The [building log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAa76--OkCjWWZBBI-jJrrksBfilDFSyNZQ9dVgOw8I/edit?usp=sharing) has the full list of unmapped buildings marked by priority.
- All three surveys and the map they create can be accessed from our [Web App](https://upenn.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5f3f039892524742b2988bc662e32ecb).If at any time you need to correct information from a survey, you may do so directly there, or email the project team at upennamp@gmail.com.
- For any questions during the map-a-thon, please use our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/accessmapping/shared_invite/enQtNDU5NjY3MjE0MzUyLWZhMjdlMGZjYThlZWUyYTkyNDdmN2M0M2ExYjdmMTYyMDA0YTc3MGQxZTBhMGEzYWZhNmUzYWUxNTk5MTk1Zjg) and we will respond as soon as we can. For urgent questions, please call Alice.

## Survey process
- For each building you are assigned, your group will collect information on [building entrances](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/990f52f117ef42709b661784212f8976)
 and [building interiors](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/5df307ba05764cb484fb8b180f53d197). Designated teams will collect information on [exterior obstructions](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/d71affce25134624811264959b0a5ab0). All three surveys will be on the [Web App](https://upenn.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5f3f039892524742b2988bc662e32ecb).
- Refer your group members to the [survey instructions and photo guidelines](https://accessibilitymapping.github.io/AMP/SurveyInstructions).
- Use the [building log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAa76--OkCjWWZBBI-jJrrksBfilDFSyNZQ9dVgOw8I/edit?usp=sharing) to record your group's progress.
- Make sure that your group members use the correct building code and building name from the sheet you have been given. If you are unable to find a building code, make sure the building name is standardized. In cases where a single structure is recorded twice on the building log, you may eliminate the redundant entry and choose the most descriptive name.

## Map-a-thon 1 March 2, 2018
Instructions for adding building information based on [Access Maps](https://www.facilities.upenn.edu/maps/pennaccess)

- Use the [building log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAa76--OkCjWWZBBI-jJrrksBfilDFSyNZQ9dVgOw8I/edit?usp=sharing) to track your progress: for each building you claim, add your name to the "Volunteer" column.
- Open the Access map from the link in the "Facilities Map" column
- Create a new [building interiors survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/2ba4b327c9e3465ba39593ff6e83a037) via the form or the [Web App](https://upenn.maps.arcgis.com/apps/CrowdsourceReporter/index.html?appid=d23c349a2c7346c0b6f39879ede52ec8). You can also use the [working map](https://upenn.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=7bc25584ac354381b9c581ea9c744e80) to add points.
- Refer to the access map and other information as you fill out the form for the building. Once you have submitted your survey, put an X in the "Interiors" column.
