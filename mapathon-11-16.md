Help make Penn’s campus more accessible by describing the spaces where you live and work!

The Accessibility Mapping Project will be hosting our next Map-a-thon on Friday, November 16 from 12:00-2:00 PM. We will meet in the Collaborative Classroom of Van Pelt Library (Room 133) for instruction and refreshments, then venture out on campus in teams. Students, staff, and faculty are invited: please bring your PennCard and a smart phone or tablet. [Registration](http://libcal.library.upenn.edu/event/4728607) is appreciated but drop-ins are welcome as well.

The [Accessibility Mapping Project](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/access-map/) is a crowd-sourced mapping initiative for Penn’s campus that invites users to record their embodied experience of campus spaces. Intended as a resource for campus navigation, the AMP tool offers user-submitted information on permanent and temporary barriers as well as other accessibility factors, such as light, allergens, gender-neutral/accessible bathrooms, and lactation spaces.


Hosted by the Outreach Subteam of the Accessibility and Learning Technologies Group, with assistance from Penn Libraries and GAPSA.
