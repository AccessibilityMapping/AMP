# Instructions for volunteer coordinators

## General instructions
1. Use the [building log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAa76--OkCjWWZBBI-jJrrksBfilDFSyNZQ9dVgOw8I/edit?usp=sharing) to record your group's progress.
2. Make sure that your group members use the correct building code and building name from the Building Log. In cases where a single structure is recorded twice on the Building Log, you may eliminate the redundant building and choose the most descriptive name. If you are unable to find a building code, make sure the building name is standardized.
3. Keep your ID and nametag visible at all times and encourage your group to do the same. Please cooperate with any instructions from public safety or building staff. 
4. If at any time you need to correct information from a survey, you may do so on the [working map](https://arcg.is/LWOfH) or email the project team at upennamp@gmail.com. Feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns

## Surveys
For each building, your group will collect information on Entrances and Building Interiors. There is a stand-alone survey for both. There is also a stand-alone survey for Obstructions. All three surveys can be accessed from the Crowdsource Reporter App.  

1. Entrances: 
	- Fill out the [entrance survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/7cd2d3bd864941a8ae3f3c0182c1da1b).
	- For "Entrance designation" choose a name (ie North entrance, main entrance, or accessible entrance) 
	- Photograph the entrance. Try to capture ground features and accessibility features. use a landscape orientation and 
	- Describe and locate building entrances. 
	- If there are multiple entrances, repeat the survey. You need not survey every entrance, but please survey at least one accessible entrance and the "main" entrance if there is an obvious one.

2. Building Interiors:
	- Fill out the [building survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/61cf45548cc0431c936dc00b9808705d).
	- To gather or verify information on building interiors, you may wish to refer to the relevant [PennAccess Map](https://www.facilities.upenn.edu/maps/pennaccess).

3. Obstructions:
	- Wherever you encounter an obstruction that may impede access, fill out the [obstruction survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/210caf35291043579e817d3b954aa2e6).
	- Photograph the obstruction

## Guidelines for photographs
- Only take photographs of building exteriors
- Avoid taking pictures with people in them (unless they have given their consent to be photographed)
- If possible, take pictures with landscape orientations to ensure proper display
- Photographs should prioritize detail over context (make sure you include the entire door, and that the automatic button is visible.

Example:
![The accessible entrance to Van Pelt Library with an automatic door]( https://services3.arcgis.com/9nfxWATFamVUTTGb/arcgis/rest/services/service_c75c8e61112e4e85ab9107f52b834f41/FeatureServer/0/6/attachments/5?token=zLIUqvzJ9i9_nX3tELKDmLeO3l4mYqOnB2_2FGldr7-FbsCOg0RLS2m1VEKHKl-cDZK-CxYaZUtHxqAfFEqHoICNXKlS_NtRuf6n8wXBJhMtSflAQVRy4k7MvpmNLjNwnOqEuwsYAwZ-NBQZeGAE11FkN8WthIOGo-OwL1Gey9_Vvpd5-q5vRugfECW-rv6EsV7g0RRycb_KdGYCQiD4yPesQt4zhfdeNHE8isMec_NB_5v1uRzKy0Otq2EpnuaZtGXomGxvcrIFD7akcpmr4UiU8mPIiAFF2ZtFtryv6Y0.)
