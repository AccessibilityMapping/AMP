# Instructions for volunteer coordinators

## General

- Keep your ID and nametag visible at all times and encourage your group to do the same. 
- Please cooperate with any instructions from public safety or building staff. If they have questions you may give them phone numbers for Mark Bookman or Alice McGrath. 
- At present we are only surveying buildings marked "1" in the priority column on the building log. We have alerted the facilities managers of these buildings. To avoid redundancy and security concerns, please stick to your designated buildings.
- If at any time you need to correct information from a survey, you may do so on the [working map](https://arcg.is/LWOfH) or email the project team at upennamp@gmail.com. 
- For any questions during the map-a-thon, please use our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/accessmapping/shared_invite/enQtMzIxNjgyMTc0NTQ2LWJkOWVhN2Q2NmU2YTA5ZTRjOTUyYmQxZmNlZDhhYmIwZWJlNGEzZGVhYTUyOGZjNDkxMGVmMzUzYTE0OWM4N2Q) and we will respond as soon as we can.

## Survey process
- For each building you are assigned, your group will collect information on [building entrances](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/7cd2d3bd864941a8ae3f3c0182c1da1b)
 and [building interiors](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/61cf45548cc0431c936dc00b9808705d). Designated teams will collect information on [exterior obstructions](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/210caf35291043579e817d3b954aa2e6). All three surveys will be on the Crowdsource Reporter App (link to come). 
- Refer your group members to the [survey instructions and photo guidelines](https://github.com/AccessibilityMapping/AMP/blob/master/SurveyInstructions.md). 
 
- Use the [building log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAa76--OkCjWWZBBI-jJrrksBfilDFSyNZQ9dVgOw8I/edit?usp=sharing) to record your group's progress.
- Make sure that your group members use the correct building code and building name from the building log. If you are unable to find a building code, make sure the building name is standardized. In cases where a single structure is recorded twice on the building log, you may eliminate the redundant entry and choose the most descriptive name.

## Feedback
- Here's a mock-up of our [Map display](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/92e0137722ef4bcd9164e63df21119c4), which we will update as data is gathered.
- Encounter any difficulties with this process? Have ideas for other categories of access? We want your feedback--email us at upennamp@gmail.com or send us a Slack message.
