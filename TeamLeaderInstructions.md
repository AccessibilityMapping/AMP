## Surveys
For each building, your group will collect information in these categories:

1. Entrances: 
	- Fill out the [entrance survey] (ENTRANCE SURVEY LINK).
	- For "Entrance designation" choose a name (ie North entrance, main entrance, or accessible entrance) 
	- Photograph the entrance. Try to capture ground features and accessibility features. use a landscape orientation and 
	- Describe and locate building entrances. 
	- If there are multiple entrances, repeat the survey. You need not survey every entrance, but please survey at least one accessible entrance and the "main" entrance if there is an obvious one.

2. Building interiors:
	- Fill out the [building survey] (BUILDING SURVEY LINK).
	- To gather or verify information on building interiors, you may wish to refer to the relevant [PennAccess Map](https://www.facilities.upenn.edu/maps/pennaccess).

3. Obstructions:
	- Wherever you encounter an obstruction that may impede access, fill out the [obstruction survey] (OBSTRUCTION SURVEY LINK).
	- Photograph the obstruction

## Guidelines for photographs
- Only take photographs of building exteriors
- Avoid taking pictures with people in them (unless they have given their consent to be photographed)
- If possible, take pictures with landscape orientations to ensure proper display
- Photographs should prioritize detail over context (make sure you include the entire door, and that the automatic button is visible.
