# Instructions for volunteer coordinators:

## General instructions
1. Use the [building log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAa76--OkCjWWZBBI-jJrrksBfilDFSyNZQ9dVgOw8I/edit?usp=sharing) to record your group's progress.
2. Make sure that your group members use the correct building code and building name. If you are unable to find a building code, make sure the building name is standardized.
3. Feel free to contact us 

## Surveys
For each building, your group will collect information in these categories:

1. Entrances: 
	- Fill out the [entrance survey] (ENTRANCE SURVEY LINK).
	- For "Entrance designation" choose a name (ie North entrance, main entrance, or accessible entrance) 
	- Photograph the entrance. Try to capture ground features and accessibility features. use a landscape orientation and 
	- Describe and locate building entrances. 
	- If there are multiple entrances, repeat the survey. You need not survey every entrance, but please survey at least one accessible entrance and the "main" entrance if there is an obvious one.

2. Building interiors:
	- Fill out the [building survey] (BUILDING SURVEY LINK).
	- To gather or verify information on building interiors, you may wish to refer to the relevant Penn Access page.

3. Obstructions:
	- Whenever you encounter an obstruction that may impede access, fill out the [obstruction survey] (OBSTRUCTION SURVEY LINK).
	- Photograph the obstruction

## Guidelines for photographs:
- Only take photographs of building exteriors
- If possible, take pictures with landscape orientations to ensure proper display
- Avoid taking pictures with people in them (unless they have given their consent to be photographed)
- Photographs should prioritize detail over context (make sure you include the entire door, and that the automatic button is visible.
Example:
